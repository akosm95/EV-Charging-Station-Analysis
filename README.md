Project Overview

This comprehensive data analysis project examined Hungary's electric vehicle charging infrastructure using data collected from the OpenChargeMap API. The analysis involved extensive data cleaning and transformation processes to standardize location information, pricing models, and operator details, followed by detailed analytical queries and visualization development.

Data Processing & Cleaning
The initial dataset underwent significant preprocessing including column selection, reverse geocoding for missing location data, standardization of county names and operator identifiers, and comprehensive pricing data cleaning to distinguish between AC/DC charging types, time-based versus per-kWh pricing models, and free versus paid services. The cleaned data was subsequently loaded into a PostgreSQL database for advanced spatial and analytical queries.

Key Analytical Components
The database analysis encompassed operational status assessment, geographic distribution analysis across cities and counties, operator market share calculations, pricing strategy comparisons, temporal growth patterns, and proximity-based location services. Advanced analyses included competitive landscape evaluation, pricing optimization opportunities, and comprehensive coverage gap identification using spatial queries.

Visualization & Reporting
Multiple Tableau dashboards were developed to provide interactive insights into charging point distribution, operational status by geographic regions, network growth trends, operator performance metrics, capacity utilization over time, postal code-level coverage analysis, temporal accessibility patterns, and payment method requirements across different operators.
